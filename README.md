TASK-01:

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
Sample Dataset :- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

Project Description

Objective:
To visualize the distribution of a specific variable from the World Bank dataset, such as the total population over a range of years. This can help in understanding trends and distributions within the data.
This project aims to visualize the distribution of total population data using the World Bank dataset, available here. The dataset includes annual population figures for various countries, which can be analyzed to understand demographic trends over time. The project involves downloading and cleaning the dataset, followed by the creation of visualizations to illustrate the data. A bar chart is used to display the total population of a specific country over the years, showing how it has changed over time. Additionally, a histogram is employed to visualize the distribution of population values, providing insights into the frequency of different population ranges. These visualizations help in understanding demographic patterns and trends, facilitating a clearer interpretation of global population dynamics.

Dataset:
The dataset used is the World Bank indicator for total population, which can be found here. The dataset typically includes yearly population data for different countries.
